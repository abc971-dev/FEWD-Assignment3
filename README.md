# FEWD-Assignment3 - Weather Journal Project

## About
This project was developed as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer program.
The aim of this project is to develop a sample app that retrieves weather data for a specific US zipcode and allows the user to enter text describing their general feeling.

The date and the temperature of the weather data as well as the text entered by the user are then displayed in a specific section displayed below the ZIP code/text entry form.

## Contents
This project is comprised of a server.js server file that defines the GET and POST routes that are necessary to store and display the weather journal data.
An app.js file that contains calls to functions that allow to post and retrieve the data. Chained promises are used to request weather data, save it along with the user's text input and finally display stored information in the web page.
An index.html file containing the form and the information display section.
A styles.css stylesheet
